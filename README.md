This a polished and user-centric interface for selecting and viewing products from distinct categories. The dynamic data retrieval ensures an interactive and seamless user experience, with comprehensive details presented for each product, including images, pricing, and optional badge information.

The page features a header with the title "SELECT YOUR CHOICE" and a section enabling users to choose between product categories such as "Men," "Women," and "Kids."

Upon selecting a category, the fetchData function is invoked to retrieve product data from a JSON file hosted on Shopify's CDN. The data is subsequently filtered based on the selected category, and the relevant product information is dynamically rendered on screen for users.

Tech Stack Used : HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
